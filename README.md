# Potato Knowledge Hub

Static microsite with modern UX and accessibility upgrades inspired by the Vercel-hosted potato experience.

## Getting started

1. Open `index.html` in any modern browser.
2. Ensure you have an internet connection so the remote hero images and Google Fonts can load.

## Highlights

- Semantic structure with `header`, `main`, `section`, `nav`, and `footer` landmarks plus a keyboard-visible skip link.
- Descriptive document title, meta description, labeled navigation, and alt text for every decorative image.
- High-contrast palette, modern typography (Inter + Spectral), and consistent spacing built on a 4/8px scale.
- Responsive flex/grid layouts, animated-yet-accessible buttons, and hover/focus states that meet WCAG AA guidance.
- Content sections for varieties, nutrition, recipes, and history so screen readers get contextually rich descriptions.
